# This is the list of recipient addresses that Postfix will rewrite on the fly.
#
# Whenever you make any changes, run `postmap recipients` to parse it; Postfix 
# then reads the parsed file.

# Mail sent to root gets rewritten as nobody@stanford.edu
root@hostname.stanford.edu  your_shared_mailbox@stanford.edu

# The username-only form can also be caught...
root    your_shared_mailbox@stanford.edu

# ... as can the hostname-only form.
root@hostname   your_shared_mailbox@stanford.edu

# In general, the only address you'll want to rewrite is root, so that 
# miscellaneous rootmail (like cron mail) actually goes somewhere!
