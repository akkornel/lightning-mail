# This is the list of sender addresses that Postfix will rewrite on the fly.
#
# Whenever you make any changes, run `postmap senders` to parse it; Postfix 
# then reads the parsed file.

# Mail sent by root gets rewritten as nobody@stanford.edu
root@hostname.stanford.edu  nobody@stanford.edu

# The username-only form can also be caught...
root    nobody@stanford.edu

# ... as can the hostname-only form.
root@hostname   nobody@stanford.edu

# It's good to have root rewritten to "nobody", so that bounced mail, 
# vacation/out-of-office notices, etc. don't get stuck somewhere.
# You could also send it to a shared mailbox, or similar location.

# You can also rewrite the sender addresses used by your applications, so that 
# replies etc. go to a support email.
webapp      support@mygroup.stanford.edu
apache2     support@mygroup.stanford.edu
httpd       support@mygroup.stanford.edu
